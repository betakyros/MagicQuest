# MagicQuest

Currently the game only works on Windows at a fixed resolution. If you're on a non-windows machine, sorry!

To play the game, just run MagicQuest.exe. Only the MagicQuest_Data folder and the MagicQuest.exe file are required to play. 

To edit and mess around with the game
1. Download or clone the files
2. Open Unity
3. Click Open
4. Select the C:\Users\The System\Documents\GitHub\MagicQuest\MagicQuest (This should be at the same level as MagicQuest _ata. Sorry about the naming). Click Open Folder.
5. In the project tab, click on scenes
6. Load the mainMenu scene.
7. Press the play button. The game should run (although I can't figure out how to get the resolution just right).
8. Edit any files you want to.
